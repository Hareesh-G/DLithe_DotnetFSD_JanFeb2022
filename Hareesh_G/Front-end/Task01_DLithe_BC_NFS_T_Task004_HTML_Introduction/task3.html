            <li>HTML
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>CSS
                <ul>
                    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
                        CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
                        CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
                        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
                        </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>Javascript
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>JQuery
                <ul>
                    <li>jQuery is a concise cross-browser, fast, small, and feature-rich library. Although there are a lot of JavaScript libraries out there, jQuery is the most popular and widely used framework by the developers. It is more flexible and easy to use as compared to other JavaScript libraries.

            </li>
            <li>SQL
                <ul>
                    <li>SQL stands for Structured Query Language
                        SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
                        SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987

            <li>Angular
                <ul>
                    <li>Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. Angular is written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your applications.

                        The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts. The basic building blocks of the Angular framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular application is defined by a set of NgModules. An application always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.</li>
